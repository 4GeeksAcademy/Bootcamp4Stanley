  <h2>Hello World with React boilerplate</h2>
  <blockquote>This template is similar to create-react-app but it's meant for 4Geeks Academy students.</blockquote>
</div>


## How to start?

First you have you choose if you are going to work locally (on your computer) or on Gitpod (on-line) 


### **If you decide to work locally**:

The first step to start coding is cloning the [vanilla.js boilerplate](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello) 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello.git
$ cd react-hello
```

### **If you are working from Gitpod** (recommended):

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello.git)


### What to do next?

1) install the npm package:
```
$ npm install
```

2) Start coding!

+ For Windows, Mac, Linux or Gitpod, start the webpack server with live reload:
- `$ npm run start`

+ You can update the `styles/index.scss` or `js/index.js` depending on your needs.
Add more files into your, `./src/js/components` or styles folder as you need them.

### Publish your website!

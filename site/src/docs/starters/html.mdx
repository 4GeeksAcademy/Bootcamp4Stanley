## How to start?

First you have you choose if you are going to work locally (on your computer) or on Gitpod (on-line):

### **If you decide to work locally**:

1) Make sure you have node.js in your computer or download it from here [from here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2) Next step would be cloning the (html boilerplate)[https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello]


### **If you are working from Gitpod** (recommended):

[[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello.git).

## What to do next?

Create a `index.html` file with the [basic HTML structure](http://content.breatheco.de/lesson/what-is-html-learn-html#page-structure) and see it live by running web-server using the following command:

```sh
$ pip3 install flask && python3 server.py
```

- You can create as many HTML files you want
- You can also create CSS files and you can import them onto your website using a `<link>` tag placed between the `<head></head>` tags, like this:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
  ...
</head>
```
